It is implemented in Python and consists of two main scripts: voicetotext.py and txttoNotion.py. Together these two scripts make up the voice-to-notion workflow.</p> <h2>How it Works</h2> <p>Voice-to-Notion continuously monitors a specified folder for new voice recordings. When it detects a new recording, it transcribes the audio to text, generates a summary, and creates a new page in a specified Notion database. The new page includes the transcript, the summary, and a shareable link to the original file in Google Drive.</p> <h2>Typical User Workflow</h2> <ol> <li>Record an audio message</li> <li>Save it to Google Drive</li> <li>voicetotext.py converts it to text</li> <li>txttoNotion.py uploads it to Notion</li> </ol> <h2>Usage</h2> <p>Setup the scripts with your credentials and run them to monitor for new recordings.</p> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li>Continuous monitoring of a folder</li> <li>Transcription with OpenAI</li> <li>Summary generation</li> <li>Upload to Notion</li> </ul> </body> </html>
